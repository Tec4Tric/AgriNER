By considering practical use of vegetable transplanting mechanism, it can be concluded that semiautomatic mechanism should be replaced with automatic mechanism due to lower field capacity as well as field efficiency of semi-automatic transplanters. The lower field capacities in semi-automatic transplanter are due to limitations on manual feeding rates of seedling which vary with respect to time and skill of the operator.
